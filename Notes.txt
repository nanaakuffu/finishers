1. Add multiple payments for one purchase.
2. Drop down for the types in purchase order and add a routine to add type.
3. Add cheque details.
4. Concatenate order ID and description in the payment form.
5. Change station to company in the order form.


SELECT tblpurchaseorderitems.poID,
		   itemDescription, SUM(itemCost) AS Cost,
       poStation,
       poDate
FROM tblpurchaseorderitems
INNER JOIN tblpurchaseordertracker
ON tblpurchaseorderitems.poID = tblpurchaseordertracker.poID
GROUP BY tblpurchaseordertracker.poID

<?php
  // if (!isset($_SESSION['update_payment'])) {
  //   echo "<select class='form-control' name='poID' id='spoID' onchange='get_order_details(this.value);'>\n";
  //     select_data($order_array, $order_id);
  //   echo "</select>";
  // } else {
  //   echo "<input class='form-control' type='text' name='poID'
  //         value=".trim($order_id)." id='tpoID' placeholder='Purchase Order ID' readonly>";
  // }
?>

Some thoughts
1. I think Date should be included as a field in the payments.
2. Also receipt number should be included as receipt is given upon payment.
